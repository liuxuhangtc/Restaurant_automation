It looks pretty good for me.
But, does there should have a exit for the program?


************ Update *************
Added package diagrams & CRC index cards

Small changes to the class diagram

I didn't have much luck finding examples of Package Diagrams in the book,
so I mostly went off of in-class examples and some online examples.
I tried out StarUML, and it seemed to format the Package Diagrams
more like the web examples, but I tried to keep the contents consistent with the in-class stuff

It seemed like the CRC index cards don't really include accessor functions in the responsibilities
column, so I left them out. This is why some classes that have several functions in the class diagram
only have one or two responsibilites in the index cards.
