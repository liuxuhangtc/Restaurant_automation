--ENTER FEEDBACK BELOW --

Stefon: Feel free to give me feedback and inform me if you would like to implement some of the code differently. 
I was thinking of having each menuitem in a hashtable for easier menu searching and adding. Although, a linked
list would be easier to implement and maintain especially if there arent many menu items to store.



--UPDATES--

1.Starting with menu component, implemented with a hashtable.
2. Finished menu component.
3. Starting on Order component, also need to implement psuedo code.
4. Added Employee component.
5. Added UI component
